## Q: Which network ports uses SSA?
**A:** SSA uses Port **29375 (UDP)** and **12842 (TCP)** to communicate with DCS lua files. For MSFS/FSX is uses SimConnect and for XPlane 11/12 **54930**.

## Q: SSA does not connect to DCS?
**A:** SSA uses UPD/TCP to send data to DCS, a firewall or VPN can block this communication, thus check if the traffic is blocked or routed through the VPN.

## Q: Are DCS mods supported by SSA?
**A:** Currently, only official DCS models are supported by DCS.

## Q: A specifiy model/plane/helicopter is not well supported, why?
**A:** Usually I need to buy these models to improve the support. Since this is a hobby project, my budget is very limited.
