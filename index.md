SimShaker for Aviators (SSA) is a software application designed for flight simulation enthusiasts to enhance their immersive experience by providing tactile feedback based on telemetry data. It works by translating various flight events (such as engine vibrations, turbulence, landing impacts, stall warnings, etc.) from flight simulators into physical vibrations or rumble effects, delivered through connected hardware like vibrating pads, bass-shakers, or similar tactile transducers.

## Supported Devices:
  - Gametrix JetSeat 
  - SimShaker JetPad 
  - Realteus ForceFeel 
  - (Limited)  Next Level Racing HF8 (supported as ForceFeel)
  - 1 to 6 bass-shakers (with the payware Sound Module addon by Andre - [SimShaker Sound Module](https://simshaker.com/software/general/sound/)) 

## Supported Games:

## Update your SimShaker for Aviators installation
Once you installed a stable or beta version, SSA will automatically check for new releases. This behavior can be disabled in the settings. Please be aware, that you stay in your current track. So if you use the beta, SSA will check for a new beta release, vice versa for stable installations.
